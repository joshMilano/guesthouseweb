          <h2 class="text-primary">Bali – Kitesurf in the Island of Gods</h2>
          <p class="lead">Kitesurf, born as a recreational sport in 1980, has not gained a lot of popularity until the end of the millennium when there were about a thousand kite surfers in the entire world but in 2005 the number increased at almost 10.000 and today
            the number of kite surfers is awesome. This aquatic discipline born from the cohesion of surf, windsurf and wake forzad, allow to let the wind push ourselves standing on a board with a kite, and sometimes it seems like flying on the waves
            giving to the kite surfer a sensation of freedom, power and sprint. It creates a sort of kite surfers’ community on the beaches, where you can admire many colourful kites trailing the kite surfers into the sea; in fact, today, the are a lot
            of fans searching for location around the world where they can practice this sport but these locations must have the predominant peculiarity of Kitesurf: the wind! To the delight of many, also Bali, the Island of Gods, it’s a destination which
            can offer a lot also for a vacation dedicated to kitesurf, even if it is an important location for surf.&nbsp;
            <br>
            <br>In Bali there are 2 monsoon seasons and the best moment to test yourself in kitesurf would be during the south-west monsoon summer, from June to August even if there could happen windy months like May or September.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>There are different big areas to practice kitesurf in Bali to satisfy every level of experience but basically the remarkable areas according to many kitesurf trainers (or not) are two: 
          <br/>
          <b>Sanur</b>: the village of Sanur is situated on the east coast
          of Bali, about 30 minutes by car from the Ngurah Rai International Airport. Sanur is the principal area and for the kitesurf beginners there is a very safe and easy wave spot with the onshore wind; in fact, there is a great lagoon of flat water
          inside the barrier reef which is really favourable for your learning and to improve your technique; an average windy day in Sanur is about 14knots and therefore is recommended to have big kites.<br/>
          <b>Canggu</b>: 35 minutes by car from Kuta, there is
          this incredible area for kite surfers with a big beach, 6km long with a lot of wave spot from the easy one with little waves to the big one with high waves over 5 metres! In Bali, this wave spot is becoming very popular and you can expect a
          lot of crowd (particularly during the peak season in Bali) no matter if the wind arrives at lunch time with about 15-20 knots during the best days.
          <br>
          <br>There are different kitesurf schools in Bali and Sanur is considered to be the best area to take classes and rent out the equipment needed. Enjoy yourselves with kitesurf in Bali and …. “Gone with the Wind”</p></div>
