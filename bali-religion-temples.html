          <h2 class="text-primary">Temples and Religion in Bali</h2>
          <p class="lead">The Balinese population is almost completely Indonesian and the 84% is of Hindu origin, but Balinese Hinduism, built-in a strong local Animism and in the Ancestors’ cult, is far away from the one originated in India, because it is rooted in
            the Balinese people that worship the same deities from India but also a supreme god, Sang Hyang Widhi, who is worshipped only in some events of the life of the farming villages. Generally, Balinese spirits and deities, have an important significance
            in the Balinese life, by controlling everything. At the bottom of it there is the coexistence of the forces of good called dharma and the forces of evil, adharma and the seek for balance and harmony within these two forces; people themselves
            live in these two opposites, and their daily rituals are therefore to maintain harmony between the two forces, freeing themselves from the never-ending cycle of reincarnation, reaching a state called mokṣa. Every morning, in the Bali island,
            people place, in every street corner, offerings of colourful flowers to calm down the evil spirits meanwhile in the fields, are placed the offerings for the good ones. Here in Bali, there are, at least, three “Pura” or temples for every village,
            which basically remain empty for most of the year, but during the period between the end of September and early October and the first half of April, they are brought back to life with theatrical performances and uncontrolled masked dances
            in order to celebrate the festivity in honour of the descent of their ancestors. There are 6 principle sacred sites in Bali:&nbsp;
            <br>1) Pura Besakih: The largest, most sacred and important temple in Bali, is the very&nbsp;panoramic Pura Besakih situated in the Eastern part of the island, on the slopes of the volcano called Mount Agung, the highest mountain of the island,
            nearly 1000 metres above sea level. It is a big complex made up of 23 temples different but connected to each other, and it is visited by a large number of tourists from all over the world every year.&nbsp;
            <br>
            <br>2) Pura Tana Loth: Even more popular and touristic is the Tana Loth&nbsp;situated in the western part of the city of Denpasar, 40 minutes by car from Kuta and Ubud. The temple is dedicated to the sea deity and is built on top of a cliff corroded
            by the time, the sea and the wind, and overlooking the sea; it is said that there was a bridge which connected the temple to the mainland but it was destroyed by a storm (Tana= land, Loth= sea). Photography enthusiasts cannot miss the opportunity
            to see the dawn and the sunset which make every photo to look spectacular with wonderful shades changing with every movement of the sunlight. In some corners of the barrier reef around the Temple, there are poisonous sea serpents which according
            to what is tell are on guard against the evil spirits.
            <br>
            <br>3) Pura Luhur Ulu Watu: “The cliff temple”, open only to Hindu observants, is situated on the southwest coast of Bali in the south of Kuta, a famous area for surfers, and it is clinging to the cliffs falling above the sea, and from which there
            is a wonderful view of the Indian Ocean. Ancient sculptures, view and Kecak dances made this excursion one of the most beautiful of the Island of Gods. A little warning: be careful to the wide range of monkeys living in the temple, very fascinated
            by tourists and by everything on which they can put their hands! 4) Pura Luhur Batukaru: Situated near the slops of the volcano Gunung Batukau, it remains one of the most mystical temples in Bali and together with the other 8 temples, is a
            part of the directional Temples called kayangan jagat. An essential element is the meru (Hindu sacred place) with seven roofs dedicated to Maha Deva, the Goddess of the mountain, Batukaru, on which the temple has been built, but it is also
            constituted by altars dedicated to the lakes Bratan, Buyan and Tamblingan. Thankfully it is not so popular among tourists and therefore it is really a pleasure to visit it accompanied by the birdsongs and the priests’ litanies.&nbsp;
            <br>
            <br>5) Pura Ulun Danu Bratan: Situated near Candikuning and completely surrounded by&nbsp;the lake Bratan, an interesting and evocative location, a good source for a lot of pictures; this Balinese temple allows the farmers to worship Dewi Danu,
            the Goddess of waters, to which the temple has been dedicated, offering ceremonies and propitiatory rituals to ask for much water.
            <br>
            <br>6) Pura Goa Lawah: also known as the “Temple of the bats cave”, this little temple, at 3 kilometres east of Kusamba, is very ancient and has a considerable importance for the Balinese people. Legend has it that the underground cavities of
            temple would reach the Pura Besakih (19 km far away). Once again according to the legend, inside the cave would live Naga Basuki, a deity with the aspect of a serpent, and the bats would be its nourishment. In fact, the bats are there and
            they are quite noisy.
