                        <h2 class="text-primary">Temples and Religion in Bali</h2>
                        <p class="lead">The Balinese population is almost completely Indonesian and the 84% is
                            of Hindu origin, but Balinese Hinduism, built-in a strong local Animism
                            and in the Ancestors’ cult, is far away from the one originated in India,
                            because it is rooted in the Balinese people that worship the same deities
                            from India but also a supreme god, Sang Hyang Widhi, who is worshipped
                            only in some events of the life of the farming villages. Generally, Balinese
                            spirits and deities, have an important significance in the Balinese life,
                            by controlling everything. At the bottom of it there is the coexistence
                            of the forces of good called dharma and the forces of evil, adharma and
                            the seek for balance and harmony within these two forces; people themselves
                            live in these two opposites, and their daily rituals are therefore to maintain
                            harmony between the two forces, freeing themselves from the never-ending
                            cycle of reincarnation, reaching a state called mokṣa. Every morning, in
                            the Bali island, people place, in every street corner, offerings of colourful
                            flowers to calm down the evil spirits meanwhile in the fields, are placed
                            the offerings for the good ones. Here in Bali, there are, at least, three
                            “Pura” or temples for every village, which basically remain empty for most
                            of the year, but during the period between the end of September and early
                            October and the first half of April, they are brought back to life with
                            theatrical performances and uncontrolled masked dances in order to celebrate
                            the festivity in honour of the descent of their ancestors. There are 6
                            principle sacred sites in Bali:&nbsp;
                            <br>1) Pura Besakih: The largest, most sacred and important temple in Bali,
                            is the very&nbsp;panoramic Pura Besakih situated in the Eastern part of
                            the island, on the slopes of the volcano called Mount Agung, the highest
                            mountain of the island, nearly 1000 metres above sea level. It is a big
                            complex made up of 23 temples different but connected to each other, and
                            it is visited by a large number of tourists from all over the world every
                            year.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>2) Pura Tana Loth: Even more popular and touristic is the Tana Loth&nbsp;situated
                            in the western part of the city of Denpasar, 40 minutes by car from Kuta
                            and Ubud. The temple is dedicated to the sea deity and is built on top
                            of a cliff corroded by the time, the sea and the wind, and overlooking
                            the sea; it is said that there was a bridge which connected the temple
                            to the mainland but it was destroyed by a storm (Tana= land, Loth= sea).
                            Photography enthusiasts cannot miss the opportunity to see the dawn and
                            the sunset which make every photo to look spectacular with wonderful shades
                            changing with every movement of the sunlight. In some corners of the barrier
                            reef around the Temple, there are poisonous sea serpents which according
                            to what is tell are on guard against the evil spirits.
                            <br>
                            <br>3) Pura Luhur Ulu Watu: “The cliff temple”, open only to Hindu observants,
                            is situated on the southwest coast of Bali in the south of Kuta, a famous
                            area for surfers, and it is clinging to the cliffs falling above the sea,
                            and from which there is a wonderful view of the Indian Ocean. Ancient sculptures,
                            view and Kecak dances made this excursion one of the most beautiful of
                            the Island of Gods. A little warning: be careful to the wide range of monkeys
                            living in the temple, very fascinated by tourists and by everything on
                            which they can put their hands! 4) Pura Luhur Batukaru: Situated near the
                            slops of the volcano Gunung Batukau, it remains one of the most mystical
                            temples in Bali and together with the other 8 temples, is a part of the
                            directional Temples called kayangan jagat. An essential element is the
                            meru (Hindu sacred place) with seven roofs dedicated to Maha Deva, the
                            Goddess of the mountain, Batukaru, on which the temple has been built,
                            but it is also constituted by altars dedicated to the lakes Bratan, Buyan
                            and Tamblingan. Thankfully it is not so popular among tourists and therefore
                            it is really a pleasure to visit it accompanied by the birdsongs and the
                            priests’ litanies.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>5) Pura Ulun Danu Bratan: Situated near Candikuning and completely surrounded
                            by&nbsp;the lake Bratan, an interesting and evocative location, a good
                            source for a lot of pictures; this Balinese temple allows the farmers to
                            worship Dewi Danu, the Goddess of waters, to which the temple has been
                            dedicated, offering ceremonies and propitiatory rituals to ask for much
                            water.
                            <br>
                            <br>6) Pura Goa Lawah: also known as the “Temple of the bats cave”, this little
                            temple, at 3 kilometres east of Kusamba, is very ancient and has a considerable
                            importance for the Balinese people. Legend has it that the underground
                            cavities of temple would reach the Pura Besakih (19 km far away). Once
                            again according to the legend, inside the cave would live Naga Basuki,
                            a deity with the aspect of a serpent, and the bats would be its nourishment.
                            In fact, the bats are there and they are quite noisy.
